# Interpreter for Core 
## Introduction
- The goal of this project is to implement an interpreter for the programming language *Core* using Java.   
- The Interpreter was designed to accomplish four main functions: 
    - tokenize input 
    - parse the tokenized input 
    - print the inputted code with correct spacing and blocks 
    - and finally execute the program. 
- The Interpreter could take input files and tokenize the inputted CORE code from said files. It would then use those tokens to parse it using a recursive decent parser that could error check and output useful errors to the user. 
- The CORE program then could be executed and return the appropriate output back to the user.

## How to compile:  
1. import this zip file into eclipse  
2. OSU library component should be included  
3. To Run TokenizerTest with arguments:  
  Run > Run Configurations > Arguments  
  and Enter your command line arguments in the Program Arguments box.   
  Then Apply and run.  

or  
Type:  
1. `mkdir bin`  

2. `javac -d bin src/edu/c3341/*.java ` 

3. `cd bin ` 

4. `java edu.c3341.Interpreter ../../../data/test33.txt ../../../data/test33data01.txt print  `

Make sure you have 3 command line arguments:  

the first argument is the program file  
The second argument is the input data file  
The third argument is the print or not print command  

Example of a command:  
`java edu.c3341.Interpreter ../../../data/test33.txt ../../../data/test33data01.txt print  ` 

## Syntax Example



    program

    int X1;
    int X2;
    int X3;
    
    begin 
        X1 = 0;
        X2 = 1;
        X3 = 2;
        X4 = 25;
        read X4;
        write X4ï¼›
        
        if (X4 > X3) then 
            X4 = X2;
        else
            X4 = X3;
        end
        
        while (!(X1 <= X3) && (X1 < X4) or (X1 >= X2)) loop
            X4 = X2
            X4 = X2 + X3;
            X4 = X2 - X3;
            X4 = X2 * X3;
            X4 = X4 + 1;
        end
    end
